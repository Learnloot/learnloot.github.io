Hey followers!

We're back again, and we're in the process of creating major revisions for in-game art and concept art.

First, we've specified our color scheme better now, and we'll be using this one:

We're also getting public domain references from various websites of what an interesting art style might look like. This one is from <a href="https://unsplash.com">Unsplash</a>:

This might change later, though - it will depend on reception.

We have also created actual concept art and in-game art, but we're not publishing it yet...

Stay tuned!!
