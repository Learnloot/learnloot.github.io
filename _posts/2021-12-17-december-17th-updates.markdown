Lately, we've developed more art AND more code.

Really - our developer has been very hard at work, and also very confused with how Python works!

And, to be fair, nobody should blame him. 

So far, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70398997/how-can-i-uninstall-a-corrupted-pip-instance-on-windows">no other programmer can figure out what is going on either</a>.

However, as for the visible parts of the game (i.e. not the data saving server, which is what we use Python for), our prototypes seem to be OK.

Keep in mind that the characters on screen are completely out of proportion and unable to move for now, but this demo is mainly to test the "skeleton" of the game.

The art part is what you see in the image. We've been doing some drawing for the game there. The background part (not the floor) is going to be re-done soon - it's supposed to be a brick, but it looks more like a server in a rack or something like that. 

That can be fixed pretty easily when we re-do it, though.
