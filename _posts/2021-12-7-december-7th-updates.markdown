Hey everybody!

We haven't been updating you as much, but we're back now.

Our first bit of news is that we're stil working on re-writing the game's storyline and changing other fundamental aspects of the game, as you may have remembered us mentioning earlier on <a href="https://twitter.com/LearnlootEdu">our Twitter</a>.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ll be re-writing the plot and re-creating the art as our old artist would like to remove their art and storyline from the game.</p>&mdash; Learnloot (@LearnlootEdu) <a href="https://twitter.com/LearnlootEdu/status/1454517410879483908?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey! We&#39;re still working on Learnloot, but there will be fewer updates as we need to work on creating some foundational aspects of the game, and we don&#39;t want to get anyone excited for things that might change quickly.</p>&mdash; Learnloot (@LearnlootEdu) <a href="https://twitter.com/LearnlootEdu/status/1461410903115632643?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Also, we shared on <a href="https://learnloot.tumblr.com/">our Tumblr</a> about some new art for characters... so, pretty much, we've dropped some awesome leaks!

Another thing we plan to post on our Twitter is that we've sucessfully raised $76.95 out of $500 for our game development costs. Thank you so much! 

We've received $20 on GoFundMe, $6.95 from our team members, and $50 in-person - thank you. :)

In conclusion, thank you for your help everyone, and we have awesome things planned! If you want to help us, you can follow us on Twitter (see the link earlier into the post) or <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/learnloot">donate on GoFundMe</a>.
