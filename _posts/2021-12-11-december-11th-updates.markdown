Hey Learnloot followers!! 

Lately, we've been working on updating our art style. :)

We're going back to something similar to the old art style:

Also, we've been planning out some awesome storyline details. Here's a little sneak peak with some redactions :o

<img src="/assets/Blog Uploads/Leak Dec 11th.png" alt="[Censored line] (New line) Is human. His hair is brown and disheveled. His clothes are grey and torn across the middle. (New line) (Bolded: Personality) Overall: Impostor syndrome of cool."  width="95%" height="30%">

We've been looking to recruit some more artists, musicians, and programmers for our awesome game, too! You can let us know on <a href="https://twitter.com/LearnlootEdu">our Twitter</a> if you're interested.

Furthermore, we've raised another $10 for the game in-person. Thank you so much :)
